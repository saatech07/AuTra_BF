 I'm Thibault, I'm 35, I'm French, and I'm based in EPAC, where I work remotely as a product advisor for a SaaS startup. I have over six years experience in product management, mostly digital products. I previously worked at an e-commerce marketplace where I overview developments of different solutions, internal tools like crowd system, dashboard, API crawling tools, and also development for the marketplace itself. Integration of new payment getaway, UI UX redesign for product page, and development of standalone web solution. So always being the interface between business, tech, and the design team. So as you can see a few keywords in my background, that matches the requirement for the role. So I'm looking forward to get to the next stage and discuss about the different needs for the position. Thanks.
